<!--Paragraph 1-->
<p>
  A lot of people don’t see the point in traveling. They assume that they can
  get everything they need from the comfort of their own homes and that it’s
   not worth the money. They usually think that traveling would be a waste of
   their time and money. Although, they don’t include the joy and wonder you
    gain from traveling around the globe when they think of planning a vacation.
  </p>

<p>
  <!--Paragraph 2-->
Vacations can be beneficial to people in many ways. One thing vacations are
great at are reducing someone’s stress. They can also improve your mental and
physical health along with your relationships. The benefits of taking a vacation
 don’t even stop there. Traveling can help people make memories to last a
 lifetime while also gaining a better understanding of the world around them
 and increasing their creativity.
