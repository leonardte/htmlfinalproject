<!--Paragraph 1-->
<p>
  A lot of people don’t see the point in traveling. They assume that they can
  get everything they need from the comfort of their own homes and that it’s
   not worth the money. They usually think that traveling would be a waste of
   their time and money. Although, they don’t include the joy and wonder you
    gain from traveling around the globe when they think of planning a vacation.
